# Introduction to HTML and CSS

Welcome to your Workspace for the the Introduction to HTML and CSS course! This space allows you to follow along with the videos shown in the course, and allows you to carry your progress - and the unique edits you've made - through to the next video.

## Using Workspaces

To view your edits in the browser, you should first make sure that you've saved all of your files in Workspaces. If the files are not saved, you will see a small orange dot next to the file name tab at the top of the page.

To save, click "File" in the navigation menu, and scroll down to "Save" or "Save All".

You may also want to use one of the keyboard shortcuts available:

### Saving your file

Operating System | Keyboard Shortcut
--- | ---
Mac OSX | **Command ⌘ + S**
Windows | **Ctrl + S**

### Undoing edits

Operating System | Keyboard Shortcut
--- | ---
Mac OSX | **Command ⌘ + Z**
Windows | **Ctrl + Z**

If you ever accidentally delete any of your files, or you want to restart your progress at the current point shown in the lesson video, you can create a new workspace. The new files will be updated to the current point in your learning process.
